# About a breathing corpse 

A breathing corpse was born while I was reading the Zen Compass.
Although I do not recall exactly in what section within the book it 
mentions it even though I skimmed through it recently and wasn't  
able to find it. I recall a section which mentions that some
monks meditate at the cementary, reminding them that they'll
die eventually. While they were meditating, they would be
asking themselves the koan or mantra <<*Who is carrying this
corpse around?*>> Perhaps someone else can pin point where exactly
within the book this is mentioned.

This resembles to me to the stoicisim's thought of *memento mori*,
which I also find pretty interesting.
