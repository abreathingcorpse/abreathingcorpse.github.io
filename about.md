# About a breathing corpse 

A breathing corpse was born while I was reading the Zen Compass.
Although I do not recall exactly in what section within the book it 
mentions it even though I skimmed through it recently and wasn't
able to find it. I recall a section which mentions that some
monks meditate at the cementary, reminding them that they'll
die eventually. While they were meditating, they would be
asking themselves the koan or mantra <<*Who is carrying this
corpse around?*>> Perhaps someone else can pin point where exactly
within the book this is mentioned.

This resembles to me to the stoicisim's thought of *memento mori*,
which I also find pretty interesting. Because I, like all living
things, will die eventually.

Supposing a Healthy Life Expectancy of around 75 years. I've still
got around 60% left, so let's try start living it properly. Which
brings me to the two purposes of this blog. First and foremost,
would be to write down my understanding of different subjects that
I learn about in order to help my future self and, hopefully, one
or two more people along the way. And secondly, would be to attempt
to narrow my focus, that is of subjects and projects.
