# The Power of Habit 

After reading The Slight Edge I went ahead and read The Power of
Habit the same year. Below are my highlighted notes:

* All our life is but a mass of habits.
* There's nothing you can't do if you get the habits right.
* Unless you deliberately fight the habit, find new routines, the
pattern will unfold automatically.
* Habits never really disappear.
* The problem is that your brain can't tell the difference between
bad and good habits.
* Habits are often as much a curse as a benefit.
* Habits are powerful, but delicate. They can be deliberately
designed.
* We often don't recognize these habits loops as they grow.
* By leraning to observe the cues and rewards, we can change the
routines.
* The brain has this amazing ability to find happoness even when the memories of it are gone.
* First, find a simple and obvious cue. Second, clearly define the
rewards.
* The cue, in addition to triggering a routine, must also trigger
a craving for the reward to come.
* Champions don't do extraordinary things, they follow the habits
they've learned.
* You can never truly extinguish bad habits. To change a habit, you
must keep the old cue, and deliver the old reward, but insert a new
routine.
* Most people's habits have occurred for so long they don't pay
attention to what causes it anymore.
* Once you recognize the cues and rewards, you're half-way to
changing it.
* A community creates belief.
* It felt good to do something that wasn't all about me.
* Belief is the biggest part of success.
* For most people who overhaul their lives, there are no seminal
moments or life-altering disasters. There are simply communities,
sometimes of just one other person, who make change believable.
* For habits to permanently change, people must believe that change
is feasable.
* Belief is easier when it occurs within a community.
* Find a support group, and use that group when you feel you might
stumble.
* Belief is essential, and it grows out of communal experience, even
if that community is only as large as two people.
* Success doesn't depent on getting every single thing right, but
instead relied on identifying a few key priorities and fashioning
them into powerful levers.
* The habits that matter most are the ones that, when they start to
shift, dislodge and remake other patterns.
* Routines are the organizational analogue of habits.
* The best agencies understood the importance of routines.
* Exercise is a keystone habit that triggers widespread change.
* Making your bed every morning is correlated with better
productivity, a greater sense of well-being, and stronger skills at
sticking with a budget.
* If you focus on changing or cultivating keystone habits, you can
cause widespread shifts.
* Crossing the gap between understanding those principles and using
them requires a bit of ingenuity.
* Small wins fuel transformative changes by leveraging tiny
advantages into patterns that convince people that bigger
achievements are within reach.
* Keystone habits transform us by creating cultures that make clear the values that, in the heat of a difficult decision or a moment of
uncertainty, we might otherwise forget.
* Self-discipline has a bigger effect on academic performance than
does intellectual talent.
* Willpower isn't just a skill. It's a muscle, and it gets tired as
it works harder, so there's less power left over for other things.
* If you want to do something that requires willpower, you have to
conserve your willpower muscle during the day.
* As people strengthened their willpower muscles in one part of
their lives, that strength spilled over into what they ate or how
hard they worked.
* As their willpower muscles strengthened, good habits seemed to
spill over into other parts of their lives. That's why signing kids up for piano lessons or sports is so
important.
* Our weak-tie acquaintances are often as influential, if not more,
than our close-tie friends.
* On a playground, peer pressure is dangerous. In adult life, it's how business gets dones and communities self-organize.
* If you teach people to live with Christian habits, they'll act as
Christians without requiring constant guidance and monitoring.
* We don't have to guide you, because you're guiding yourself. These
habits become a new self-identity.
* For an idea to grow beyond a community, give people new habits
that help them figure out where to go on their own.
* Movements rely on social patterns that begin as the habits of
friendship, grow through the habits of communities, and are
sustained by new habits that change participants' sense of self.
* Just as a piece of land has to be prepared beforehand, so the mind
of the pupil has to be prepared in its habits if it is to enjoy and
dislike the right things.
* Everything we know about habits is that any of them can be
changed, if you understand how they function.
* Every habit, no matter its complexity, is malable.
* To modify a habit, you must decide to change it. You must
consciously accept the hard work of identifying the cues and rewards
that drive the habits' routines, and find alternatives. You must
know you have control and be self-conscious enough to use it.
* Once you know a habit exists, you have the responsability to
change it.
* Once you understand that habits can change, you have the freedom,
and the responsability, to remake them.
* Once you understand that habits can be rebuilt, the only option
left is to get to work.
* All our life is but a mass of habits bearing us irresistibly
toward our destiny, whatever the latter may be.
* Habits are what allow us to "do a thing with difficulty the first
time, but soon do it more and more easily, and finally, with
sufficient practice, do it semi-mechanically, or with hardly any
consciousness at all.
* Once we choose who we want to be, people grow to the way in which
they have been exercised.
* Your habits are what you choose them to be.
* Habits, just by looking at them, become visible again.
* A habit is a choice that we deliberately make at some point, and
then stop thinking about, but continue doing, often every day.
