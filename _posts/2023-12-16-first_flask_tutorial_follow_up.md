# Flaskr not logging in 

So, my deadline for finishing up the Flask Tutorial was supposed to
be yesterday. Sadly, I hit a wall last night when going through the
Blog Blueprint section. I was pretty sure that I'd done everything
right but, alas, nothing happens whener I log into my account.
Supposedly, the header should update and have a link to the create
view but, that's not happening.

However, I spent only around 5 hours within those 8 days. That's
half of the 10 hours that I assumed it'd take. What's going to be my
next goal then? This is taking far too long. I can't have a goal of
when I'll be able to finish the tutorial if I can't solve this log
in issue first. But, how long will it take? That I do not know, it
could take me 1 day to figure out, or perhaps I simply give up. So,
I'll simply give myself 4 days. Hopefully I'll be able to figure it
out by then.
