# New Year, new priorities

At the end of last year, my priority was to learn Flask in order to
develop a Dashboard and land a DevOps job. I questioned that idea at
the start of this year. I joined both, the Global Game Jam,
as well as the Pirate Jam last month. I tried to learn this new
library called raylib & C++. At the end, I decided to get back to
learning C++ & SFML this year.
