# The Slight Edge 

This books suggests that one highlights it, in order to recall the
good parts of it. I've read it about 5 years back and hightlighted
it. I've always wanted to share & store what I highlighted back then
but, I simply didn't get around it well. Here it's:

* I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. You get busy
living or you get busy dying.
* They do the thing, and gain the power.
* Master the mundane.
* What you do *today* matters. What you do *every day* matters.
* No immediate feedback.
* You can't find it in the past or on the future, only right here,
right now.
* The difficult is what takes a little time; the impossible is what
takes a little longer.
* Be happy, and the reason will appear.
* Strange, isn't it? Each man's life touches so many other lives.
* If you are not making someone else's life better you are wasting
your time. Your life will only become better by helping make other
lives better.
* Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens
can change the world.
* A single thoughtful, committed person can change the world.
* The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
* While that penny may be small, it's far from insignificant. It
makes *all* the difference.
* *You* started as a penny.
* Greatness is always in the moment of the decsion.
* I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the
difference.
* A man can fail many times, but he isn't a failure until he begins
to blame somebody else.
* We tend to desire what we lack, and lack what we desire.
* Chances are good that when you step out onto the path of mastery,
you will step out alone.
* Give me six hours to chop on a tree, and I will spend the first
four hours sharpening the axe.
* Just do it. Learn by doing.
* Knowledge without practice is useless, and practice without
knowledge is dangerous.
* Read it, apply it, take that experience back to your reading,
deepen your understanding, take that understanding back to your
activity... it's a never ending cycle.
* Apollo's rocket degree of accuracy would be perfectly on course
no more than ten days in any given year. The next time you're
giving yourself a hard time because you feel like you've gotten
off track, give yourself a break.
* In getting from point A to poing B you'll be off track most of the time. It's the adjustments, seemingly insignificant corrections,
that have the most power in your life.
* The slight edge is a process. You make that choice moment to
moment to moment and keep making it. At first, it requires your
constant awareness. In time, it becomes automatic.
* Self-investment is to train how you think and what you think.
* It's essential that you take charge of your automatic pilot's
training.
* Become acutely aware of who you are modeling.
* Be not afraid of going slowly; be afraid only of standing still.
* Virtually all natural systems, have intrinsically optimal rates.
When growth becomes excessive, the system itself will seek to
compensate by slowing down.
* Give yourself something to work toward *constantly*.
* All you can do is all you can do, but all you can do is enough.
* The power of momentum: steady wins the race.
* Looking for the best in people serves you; anticipating their
worst doesn't.
* The way to erase a bad habit is to erase it with a positive habit.
* First comes the thought; then organization of that thought into
ideas and plans; then transformation of those plans into reality.
The beginning, is in your imagination.
* You must make it specific, give it a deadline. You must have a
plan to start with.
* Make your dream more concrete: *what* and *when*.
* Your dreams are real. Not only are they possible: they are
*inevitable*.
* You have to start with a plan, but the plan you start with will
not be the plan that gets you there.
* A plan is only your jumping-off point.
* Success is the progressive realization of a worthy ideal.
* You have to start with the philosophy that will take you there.
* The point of the plan is not that it will get you there, but that
it will get you started.
* The most significant factors in your happiness are *your actions*.
* Happiness is like health. There are concrete steps you need to
take to make it happen.
* Resolve to stop following that Parkinson's Law lament: Whatever I
have, I spend.
* Why am I doing this?
* Keep your eyes on the prize.
* Successful people work on their philosophy first.
* Understand the power of daily disciplines.
