# First Project

Since I'm looking for a job within a DevOps project I need to work
on projects that could help me out and actually finish them. Not
just start them out and leave them hanging. Which is why I'm
thinking of building a Dashboard using Flask. This would freshen up
my Python skills and I'd be able to demonstrate that I can build a
Dashboard.

Now, what should be my dashboard about? Since I like videogames, I'm
planning on making a Dashboard related to a Web Browser game, which
is called Neptune's Bounty. The game has an API which I could use
to read the values from a JSON format.
