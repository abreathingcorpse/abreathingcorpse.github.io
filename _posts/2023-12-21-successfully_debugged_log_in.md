# Successfully debugged the Log In

I managed to find the bug last night. Right on schedule. It was only
a matter of an extra indentation, I removed the extra indentation
and now the Log In was working.

I managed to finish the Blog Blueprint section of the Flaskr
tutorial. For now, I'll simply enjoy the Holidays and make another
post upon my arrival.
