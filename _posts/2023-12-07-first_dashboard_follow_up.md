# Smaller Goal

Sadly, it has been a while. My idea is that this shouldn't take
longer than 2 weeks or about 20 hours. The truth is that only
yesterday was I able to properly finish up the Templates section.
I spent around 9 hours in 16 days. I did realize, however, that
looking at my calendar and seeing the deadline helped out a ton.
That's when I finally began to take this on a more serious manner.
That being said, having a two week goal seems to be too far off.
So let's try to come up with smaller goals then. The next goal would
be: Finishing the Flask Tutorial. I think I should be able to finish
it within 8 days or about 10 hours.
